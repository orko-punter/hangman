hangman hollywood/bollywood-version -: 

This is a super simple code to play the hollywood/bollywood version of hangman. Basically a movies list is imported through a txt file and then the user is asked to guess the name of the film from the given sequence of letters and blanks (in proper order). The user gets 8 chances. This is all the hangman beginners out there, therefore all the vowels come pre-loaded.
